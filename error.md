Known Issues and Solutions with UI Kitten Components
TypeScript Errors for Missing Exports:

Error: Module '"@ui-kitten/components"' has no exported member 'IconRegistry'.
Solution: Add the missing export declaration in your type definition file (e.g., ui-kitten.d.ts):
typescript
Copy code
export const IconRegistry: React.FC<{
  icons: any; // Adjust as necessary
}>;
Error for ApplicationProvider:

Error: Module '"@ui-kitten/components"' has no exported member 'ApplicationProvider'.
Solution: Ensure that the declaration for ApplicationProvider is included in your type definition:
typescript
Copy code
export const ApplicationProvider: React.FC<{
  mapping?: Mapping;
  theme?: any; // Adjust the type as necessary
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>;
Error for StyleService:

Error: Module '"@ui-kitten/components"' has no exported member 'StyleService'.
Solution: Include the StyleService export in your declaration file:
typescript
Copy code
export const StyleService: {
  create: (styles: any) => any; // Adjust the type as necessary
};
Error for Icon Component:

Error: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined when using the Icon component.
Solution: Ensure the Icon component is used correctly and that the name prop is passed correctly from the contact data. Check for the existence of the contact and its properties before rendering.
Handling Undefined Props:

When rendering components that rely on props, ensure you handle potential undefined values:
typescript
Copy code
<Icon name={contact?.iconName || 'default-icon'} />
General Recommendations
Type Definitions: Make sure your custom type definition files (like ui-kitten.d.ts) are correctly set up to reflect the components and props you are using.
Component Usage: Always check that the components are being used with the necessary props and that the data they depend on is available.
Debugging: Use console logs to help debug issues related to undefined properties and to trace the flow of data through your components.
Feel free to add any additional issues you encounter as you continue working with UI Kitten, and update this document as needed!
