## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager, which comes with Node.js)
- React Native CLI or Expo CLI (if applicable)
- A mobile device or emulator for testing (Android or iOS)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zarksoad/vehicleMaintenance-React-native.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

    bash

cd vehicleMaintenance-React-native

Install the project dependencies:

bash

    npm install

Starting the Project

After installing the dependencies, you can start the React Native project.
For Android:

Make sure you have an Android emulator running or a physical device connected.

bash

npx react-native run-android

For iOS:

Make sure you have Xcode installed and an iOS simulator running.

bash

npx react-native run-ios

Using JSON Server

To set up a mock backend for your application, you can use JSON Server. Follow these steps:

    Navigate to the server directory (if applicable). If you don't have a server directory, you can create a new one and set up your JSON server there.

    bash

cd server

Install JSON Server if you haven't already:

bash

npm install -g json-server

Create a db.json file in the server directory. Here’s a sample structure:

json

{
  "employees": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "position": "Software Engineer"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "position": "Product Manager"
    }
  ]
}

Start the JSON server:

bash

    json-server --watch db.json --port 3000

    This will start the server at http://localhost:3000, where your application can fetch data.

### Notes

- **JSON Server Directory**: Ensure you have a `server` directory with a `db.json` file for the JSON server. Adjust the instructions if your project structure is different.
- **Customization**: You may want to include additional sections like "Usage," "Features," or "Screenshots" based on what your project entails.
- **Testing**: Consider adding instructions for running tests if your project includes them.

Feel free to modify any sections as needed. If you need further assistance or adjustments, just let me know!
